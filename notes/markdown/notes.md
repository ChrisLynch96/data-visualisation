# Graphics fundamentals

Building blocks:

- Position
- Colour
- Size
- angle
- curvature
- shape
- motion

curves -> splines

Note: Shiny from RStudio as a vis tool

# Visual Encoding

Quantitative Data, Categorical Data

Visualization tasks:

- Identify
- Locate
- Distinguish
- Categorize
- Cluster
- Rank
- Compare
- Associate
- Correlate

Visual Encoding Channels (The eight visual variables):

- Position
- Mark
- Size
- Brightness
- Color
- Orientation
- Texture
- Motion

Characteristics of a channel

- Selective
- Associative
- Quantitative
- Ordinal
- Range

Note: more dimensions weakens the usefulness of size as a channel

Note: Avoid colour for quantitative datasets

Colour affects quantifiability + categorization

How to Rank channels:

1. Accuracy
2. Discriminability
3. Separability
4. Popout
5. Grouping

# Data and Task abstractions

Types:

- Tables
- Networks and Trees
- Field
- Geometry
- Set
- List
- Cluster

Note: Task Abstraction has a pipeline for determining a visualization

Spatial encoding is the most effective encoding channel

Spatial encoding used to express the directly express the value of a quantitative attribute
