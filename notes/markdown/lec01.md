## Human in the Loop

Visualisation is needed when pue computational processes can't guarantee an answer.

- Question is not clear in advance
- Problems are ill-specified for automated encoding
- Solution is better fit for human intuition/experience
- Solutions are not yet developed
- Solution required human oversight in addition to automated processes
